# VS Code Marketplace Description Options

## Current Description
```
Blocks AI code changes unless they carry proof: routes, env vars, auth boundaries, and contracts—verified or blocked.
```

## Recommended Options

### Option 1: Problem-Solution Focus (Recommended)
```
Stop AI context drift before it ships. Blocks ghost routes, env vars, and auth mismatches unless proven against repo truth. Proof-carry-change for Cursor, Copilot, Claude, and Windsurf.
```
**Length**: 147 characters  
**Why**: Clear problem (context drift), solution (proof-carry-change), and AI tools mentioned

---

### Option 2: Feature-First
```
Agent Firewall: Blocks AI code changes that reference non-existent routes, env vars, or auth boundaries. Enforces proof-carry-change for Cursor, Copilot, Claude, Windsurf.
```
**Length**: 152 characters  
**Why**: Leads with "Agent Firewall" feature name, lists what it blocks

---

### Option 3: Value Proposition
```
Prevents AI coding mistakes: blocks ghost endpoints, missing env vars, and auth drift. Your AI agent must prove changes against repo truth or they're blocked.
```
**Length**: 140 characters  
**Why**: Focuses on preventing mistakes, clear value

---

### Option 4: Short & Punchy
```
Agent Firewall for AI coding. Blocks ghost routes, env vars, and auth drift unless proven. Works with Cursor, Copilot, Claude, Windsurf.
```
**Length**: 130 characters  
**Why**: Concise, mentions all key AI tools, clear benefit

---

### Option 5: Technical + Benefits
```
Proof-carry-change for AI agents. Validates routes, env vars, auth, and contracts against repo truthpack. Blocks unproven changes in Cursor, Copilot, Claude, Windsurf.
```
**Length**: 155 characters  
**Why**: Technical term (proof-carry-change), lists validation types, mentions tools

---

## My Recommendation: **Option 1**

**Why Option 1 is best:**
- ✅ Starts with the problem (context drift)
- ✅ Clear solution (proof-carry-change)
- ✅ Mentions all major AI tools
- ✅ Under 150 characters (marketplace sweet spot)
- ✅ Action-oriented ("Stop" vs "Prevents")
- ✅ Includes keywords for discoverability

## For package.json

Use this in `package.json`:

```json
"description": "Stop AI context drift before it ships. Blocks ghost routes, env vars, and auth mismatches unless proven against repo truth. Proof-carry-change for Cursor, Copilot, Claude, and Windsurf."
```

---

## Alternative: Even Shorter (if needed)

If marketplace has stricter limits:

```
Agent Firewall: Blocks AI code changes unless proven against repo truth. Stops ghost routes, env vars, auth drift. Works with Cursor, Copilot, Claude, Windsurf.
```
**Length**: 135 characters
