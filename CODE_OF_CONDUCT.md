## Our Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- **GitHub** — Issues, pull requests, discussions, code reviews
- **Discord** — All channels and direct messages
- **Twitter/Social Media** — When representing the project
- **Events** — Conferences, meetups, virtual events
- **Email** — Project-related correspondence

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to:

- **Email**: [conduct@vibecheckai.dev](mailto:conduct@vibecheckai.dev)
- **Discord**: Contact any moderator privately

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### What Happens Next

1. **Acknowledgment** — We'll confirm receipt within 24 hours
2. **Review** — The conduct team will review the report
3. **Decision** — A decision will be made based on our guidelines
4. **Action** — Appropriate action will be taken
5. **Follow-up** — We'll inform you of the outcome

### Confidentiality

We treat all reports confidentially. We will not disclose the identity of reporters without their explicit consent, except as required by law.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Minor inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeal Process

If you believe a decision was made in error, you may appeal by:

1. Emailing [appeals@vibecheckai.dev](mailto:appeals@vibecheckai.dev)
2. Explaining why you believe the decision was incorrect
3. Providing any additional context

Appeals will be reviewed by a different member of the conduct team.
